      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a career changer, switching from the fields of Science education
        and research to scientific computing. My first formal software
        development project was for my graduate thesis where, using front end
        tools, I built an user friendly repository for species based scientific
        literature reviews; 
        </p>

        <p>I am an experienced full stack web/software
        developer, currently completing a course in Full Stack Web Development
        at University of Miami. During my course I had the opportunity to work
        on a collaborative group project, where we conceived and executed a CMS
        application that solved a real-world problem. This full-stack
        application, combined a robust back endâ€”with servers, databases,
        advanced APIs, and user authentication. I have experience in creating my
        own server-side APIs using the Express.js framework. In addition to
        building the Express.js API, I have had practice connecting the back end
        to a relational database using MySQL. Additionally, I have experience
        taking a working Express.js API and configuring it to use Sequelize to
        interact with a MySQL database. I have developed several applications
        following the RESTful API architectural pattern. In addition to
        applications that I developed to run in the browser and feature
        dynamically updated HTML and CSS, fetching data from third party API's.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have a unique combination of skills and work experience in the field
        of Science education and research. My tenure in education and research
        allowed me to sharpen my soft skills in communication, critical
        thinking, time management and empathy, and I have the ability to work
        independently to achieve goals in a fast paced, agile environment.
